## Usage

I am on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

1) clone this repo into $HOME root with original name:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/guoqiao/gnome-dynamic-wallpapers.git
```

2) refresh xml for all wallpapers if you put repo at different path:

```
cd gnome-dynamic-wallpapers
./gnome-dynamic-wallpaper-xml-generator.py
```

background xml for each wallpaper is at `./wallpapers/xxx/xxx.xml`.

3) choose wallpaper xml

GNOME Tweaks -> Appearance -> Background -> Image -> Select ./wallpapers/xxx/xxx.xml

Now your desktop will auto change wallpaper according to your current hour.

## How it works

GNOME allows you to use xml file to define a slide and use it as wallpaper.
If you take a photo for a view at each hour, and define a slide to switch to the corresponding photo for current hour, you get a dynamic wallpaper.

## How to add a new dynamic wallpaper

1) create a new folder in ./wallpapers/, the folder name will be used as the wallpaper name.
2) put 24 photos into the folder with name `0.png`, `1.png`, ..., `23.png`.
E.g.: `9.png` will be displayed at 09:00.
Only the number in basename matters, extension not.
You can use whatever image formats, such as `.jpeg`.
If you don't have enough 24 photos, you can create links for those missing.
3) run `./gnome-dynamic-wallpaper-xml-generator.py` again, xml will be generated in your new wallpaper folder.

## How to slide quicker ?

run:

```
./gnome-dynamic-wallpaper-xml-generator.py -s 1 -t 2
```

This will render xml with static duration 1s (`-s 1`) and transaction duration 2s (`-t 2`).
The demo wallpapers are generated by this :)

The default 24h slide is equivalent to:

```
./gnome-dynamic-wallpaper-xml-generator.py -s 3595 -t 5
```
